#This might be the most stupid project ever in the history of UTSC's CSCA20 course.#
 
The goal of our project is to create a criminal record system that can read, write and manipulate data in a record file.
Currently the project is still under development, so it might gradually update as time goes 
(and eventually become something completely different).
